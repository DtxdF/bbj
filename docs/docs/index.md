# Bulletin Butter & Jelly
## A simple community textboard
### BBJ is a trivial collection of python scripts and database queries that miraculously shit out a fully functional client-server textboard.

See also: the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/desvox/bbj).

BBJ is heavily inspired by image boards like 4chan, but it offers a simple
account system to allow users to identify themselves and set profile
attributes like a more traditional forum. Registration is optional and there
are only minimal restrictions on anonymous participation.

Being a command-line-oriented text board, BBJ has no avatars or file sharing
capabilties, so its easier to administrate and can't be used to distribute illegal
content like imageboards. It has very few dependancies and is easy to set up.

The API is simple and doesn't use require complex authorization schemes or session management.
It is fully documented on this site (though the verbage is still being revised for friendliness)
