    Takes a string, sexpifies it, and returns a list of lists

    Within each paragraph, [0] is either None or a markup directive,
    and [1] is the body of text to which it applies. This representation
    is very easy to handle for a client. It semi-supports nesting:
    eg, the expression [red: this [blue: is [green: mixed]]] will
    return [("red", "this "), ("blue", "is "), ("green", "mixed")],
    but this cannot effectively express an input like
    [bold: [red: bolded colors.]], in which case the innermost
    expression will take precedence. For the input:
        "[bold: [red: this] is some shit [green: it cant handle]]"
