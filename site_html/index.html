                    Bulletin Butter &amp; Jelly is a client/server textboard, tailored for use on
                    the UNIX command line. It has a simple API, allows anonymous participation,
                    and Markdown-esque text formatting.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BBJ is heavily inspired by image boards like 4chan, but it offers a simple
                    account system to allow users to identify themselves and set profile
                    attributes like a more traditional forum. Registration is optional and there
                    are only minimal restrictions on anonymous participation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a command-line-oriented text board, BBJ has no avatars or file sharing
                    capabilties, so its easier to administrate and can't be used to distribute illegal
                    content like imageboards. It has very few dependancies and is easy to set up.
